## Setting Up Github Pages

Github Pages is a feature of github that allows you to create a static website for your projects. It's free and quite easy to setup. This isn't a full guide for Github pages, but just shows how to configure it for this use case. When you create a github pages site for your project it will live under *USER_NAME*.github.io/*REPO_NAME*, so for example the URL for this repo would be `witnessmenow.github.io/ESP-Web-Tools-Tutorial`

1. Click `Settings` on the repo you want to add the website to and scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` section
2. Under `Source`, change the drop down to your `main` branch (could be `master` if it's an older repo) 

And that's it! when you visit *USER_NAME*.github.io/*REPO_NAME* you should see your projects readme converted to a webpage.

This was actually the part I found the hardest, just because I was completely unfamilar what happens once you cick "Upload"!
